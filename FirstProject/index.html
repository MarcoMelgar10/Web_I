            This is a biography about the Lorax 
        </h2>
         <p>
        The Lorax is a children's book written by Dr. Seuss and published in 1971.[2] It chronicles the plight of the environment and the Lorax,
        the main character, who "speaks for the trees" and confronts the Once-ler, a business magnate who causes environmental destruction.
        The story is commonly recognized as a fable concerning the danger of humanity's greed causing destruction of the natural environment, using the literary element of personification
        to create relatable characters for industry (the Once-ler), the environment (the Truffula trees) and environmental activism (the Lorax). The story encourages activism and involvement in making the situation better: a quote from the Lorax states,
        "Unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot, nothing is going to get better. It's not". The Lorax exemplifies Dr. Seuss's views 
        on climate change and pollution, teaching children about the importance of doing their part to protect the environment (in this case, Truffula trees).
